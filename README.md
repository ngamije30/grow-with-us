solve these errors 

I see the npm installation errors. Let's fix these issues step by step:
First, let's clear the npm cache and delete the node_modules:
Apply to main.js
Run
Update your frontend package.json to ensure compatible versions:
Apply to main.js
Try installing with a specific npm registry and without SSL:
Apply to main.js
Run
If that doesn't work, try:
Apply to main.js
Run
If you're still having SSL issues, try setting the Node.js SSL environment variable:
Apply to main.js
Run
If the issues persist, try using yarn instead:
Apply to main.js
Run
If you're still having problems, try installing packages one by one:
Apply to main.js
Run
For development dependencies:
Apply to main.js
Run
After successful installation, set up your tailwind.config.js:
Apply to main.js
Initialize Tailwind CSS:
Apply to main.js
Run
Make sure your next.config.js is properly configured:
Apply to main.js
Try running the development server after successful installation:
Apply to main.js
Run
If you're still experiencing issues, you can try:
Using a different Node.js version (try v18 LTS)
Checking your network connection and proxy settings
Using a VPN if you're having regional registry issues
Would you like me to:
Help troubleshoot any specific remaining errors?
Set up alternative package installation methods?
Configure specific packages that aren't working?
Help with any other setup issues?
Let me know what issues persist after trying these solutions!
Can you look into both backend and fronted development of this project and tell me the errors in these codes

I'll analyze both frontend and backend code to identify errors. Let me check both directories:
First, let's check the Backend (Backend-Development/grow-with-us-backend):
Apply to main.js
Let's fix these backend issues:
Update src/app.ts:
Apply to main.js
Update src/routes/user.routes.ts:
Apply to main.js
Now let's check the Frontend (Frontend-Development/grow-with-us):
Apply to main.js
Let's fix these frontend issues:
Update src/app/layout.tsx:
Apply to main.js
Create src/app/providers.tsx:
Apply to main.js
Create API utility (src/lib/api.ts):
Apply to main.js
Common issues to fix in both:
Backend:
Missing proper error handling
Incomplete validation
Missing TypeScript types
Incorrect middleware order
Missing security headers
Frontend:
Missing loading states
Improper error handling
Missing type definitions
Incorrect API integration
Missing authentication flow
Would you like me to:
Show the complete fixed code for any specific file?
Add proper error handling and validation?
Set up the authentication flow?
Fix API integration between frontend and backend?
Let me know which specific issues you'd like me to address first!
fix all those issues

I'll fix all issues systematically. Let's start with the complete setup:

Apply to main.js
Frontend (package.json):
Apply to main.js
Run these commands:
Backend:
Apply to main.js
Run
Frontend:
Apply to main.js
Run
Would you like me to:
Add more components?
Set up protected routes?
Add more API endpoints?
Implement additional features?
Let me know what you'd like me to focus on next!
correct this error

I see the specific error - it's in your user.routes.ts file where the updateProfile route handler is undefined. Let's fix this:
Update your src/routes/user.routes.ts:
The error occurred because:
The updateProfile handler was not defined
The route was trying to use an undefined function
The fix:
Added the updateProfile handler function
Added proper validation for profile updates
Added proper error handling
Added TypeScript types
Now try running the server again:
Apply to main.js
Run
The error should be resolved. Let me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues!
solve all the issues and create the read me file showing how to run the host

I'll create a comprehensive README.md file and fix all issues:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd grow-with-us
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd Backend-Development/grow-with-us-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/grow_with_us"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
PORT=5000
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd Frontend-Development/grow-with-us

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env.local file
cp .env.example .env.local
